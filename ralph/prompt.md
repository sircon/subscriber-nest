# Ralph Agent Instructions

You are an autonomous coding agent working on the AudienceSafe project.

## Repository Overview

This is a **Turborepo monorepo** with the following structure:

```
subscriber-nest/
├── apps/
│   ├── backend/          # NestJS application (TypeORM + PostgreSQL)
│   │   └── src/         # Backend source code
│   └── frontend/         # Next.js application (App Router)
│       └── src/         # Frontend source code
├── ralph/                # Ralph agent files (PRD, progress, skills)
│   ├── prd.json         # Product Requirements Document
│   ├── progress.txt     # Progress log with patterns
│   └── skills/          # Structured instruction sets
├── turbo.json           # Turborepo configuration
└── package.json         # Root dependencies and scripts
```

**Tech Stack:**
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo workspace
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeORM and PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router) with React
- **Package Manager**: Yarn
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

**Key Commands:**
- `yarn dev` - Start both apps in development mode
- `yarn build` - Build all apps
- `yarn lint` - Run linter for all apps
- `yarn start` - Start all apps in production mode
- `turbo run dev --filter=backend` - Start only backend dev server
- `turbo run dev --filter=frontend` - Start only frontend dev server
- `turbo run build --filter=backend` - Build only backend
- `turbo run build --filter=frontend` - Build only frontend

**Important Paths:**
- Backend code: `apps/backend/src/`
- Frontend code: `apps/frontend/src/`
- Database config: `apps/backend/src/data-source.ts`
- Migrations: `apps/backend/src/migrations/` (compiled to `dist/migrations/`)

## Your Task

1. Read the PRD at `ralph/prd.json`
2. Read the progress log at `ralph/progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)
3. Check you're on the correct branch from PRD `branchName`. If not, check it out or create from main.
4. Pick the **highest priority** user story where `passes: false`
5. Implement that single user story
6. Run quality checks (e.g., `yarn lint`, `yarn build`, `yarn exec tsc` - use whatever your project requires)
7. Update AGENTS.md files if you discover reusable patterns (see below)
8. If checks pass, commit ALL changes with message: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
9. Update the PRD at `ralph/prd.json` to set `passes: true` for the completed story
10. Append your progress to `ralph/progress.txt`

## Progress Report Format

APPEND to ralph/progress.txt (never replace, always append):

```
## [Date/Time] - [Story ID]
- What was implemented
- Files changed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered (e.g., "this codebase uses X for Y")
  - Gotchas encountered (e.g., "don't forget to update Z when changing W")
  - Useful context (e.g., "the evaluation panel is in component X")
---
```

The learnings section is critical - it helps future iterations avoid repeating mistakes and understand the codebase better.

## Consolidate Patterns

If you discover a **reusable pattern** that future iterations should know, add it to the `## Codebase Patterns` section at the TOP of ralph/progress.txt (create it if it doesn't exist). This section should consolidate the most important learnings:

```
## Codebase Patterns
- Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations
- Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations
- Example: Export types from actions.ts for UI components
```

Only add patterns that are **general and reusable**, not story-specific details.

## Update AGENTS.md Files

Before committing, check if any edited files have learnings worth preserving in nearby AGENTS.md files:

1. **Identify directories with edited files** - Look at which directories you modified
2. **Check for existing AGENTS.md** - Look for AGENTS.md in those directories or parent directories
3. **Add valuable learnings** - If you discovered something future developers/agents should know:
   - API patterns or conventions specific to that module
   - Gotchas or non-obvious requirements
   - Dependencies between files
   - Testing approaches for that area
   - Configuration or environment requirements

**Examples of good AGENTS.md additions:**

- "When modifying X, also update Y to keep them in sync"
- "This module uses pattern Z for all API calls"
- "Tests require the dev server running on PORT 3000"
- "Field names must match the template exactly"

**Do NOT add:**

- Story-specific implementation details
- Temporary debugging notes
- Information already in progress.txt

Only update AGENTS.md if you have **genuinely reusable knowledge** that would help future work in that directory.

## Quality Requirements

- ALL commits must pass your project's quality checks (typecheck, lint, test)
- Do NOT commit broken code
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Follow existing code patterns

## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)

For any story that changes UI, you MUST verify it works in the browser:

1. Use browser automation tools to navigate to the relevant page
2. Verify the UI changes work as expected
3. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log
4. Test the functionality interactively

A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.

## Stop Condition

After completing a user story, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.

If ALL stories are complete and passing, reply with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

If there are still stories with `passes: false`, end your response normally (another iteration will pick up the next story).

## Important

- Work on ONE story per iteration
- Commit frequently
- Keep CI green
- Read the Codebase Patterns section in ralph/progress.txt before starting
- Use Turborepo commands (`turbo run dev`, `turbo run build`, `turbo run lint`) for running tasks
- Backend code goes in `apps/backend/src/`, frontend code in `apps/frontend/src/`
- Check app-specific `AGENTS.md` files (`apps/backend/AGENTS.md`, `apps/frontend/AGENTS.md`) for detailed patterns
- Use `--filter` flag to run commands for specific apps (e.g., `turbo run dev --filter=backend`)
