## 2026-01-18 15:18 - US-001
- Created shared package directory structure at `packages/shared/src/` with all required subdirectories (entities, dto, services, events, interfaces, types)
- Updated root `package.json` to include `packages/*` in workspaces configuration
- Fixed linting error in `apps/frontend/next-env.d.ts` (prettier quote style)
- Files changed:
  - `package.json` - Added `packages/*` to workspaces
  - `apps/frontend/next-env.d.ts` - Fixed quote style for linting
  - Created directory structure: `packages/shared/src/{entities,dto,services,events,interfaces,types}/`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Empty directories are not tracked by git until files are added (this is expected behavior)
  - Root `package.json` workspaces must include both `apps/*` and `packages/*` for monorepo structure
  - Turborepo automatically recognizes new workspaces once added to root package.json
  - Use `yarn lint` and `yarn build` to verify changes don't break existing code
---

## 2026-01-18 15:25 - US-002
- Created `packages/shared/package.json` with name `@subscriber-nest/shared`, version, and proper exports configuration for all subdirectories (entities, dto, services, events, interfaces, types)
- Created `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` with TypeScript configuration matching backend settings (commonjs, ES2022 target, decorators enabled)
- Created index.ts files for all subdirectories with empty exports to make them valid TypeScript modules
- Configured TypeScript paths in `apps/backend/tsconfig.json` to include `@subscriber-nest/shared` and `@subscriber-nest/shared/*` aliases pointing to `../../packages/shared/src`
- Root `package.json` already had `packages/*` in workspaces from US-001
- Files changed:
  - `packages/shared/package.json` - Created with exports configuration
  - `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` - Created with TypeScript config
  - `packages/shared/src/index.ts` - Main entry point
  - `packages/shared/src/{entities,dto,services,events,interfaces,types}/index.ts` - Subdirectory entry points
  - `apps/backend/tsconfig.json` - Added path aliases for shared package
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Empty TypeScript files need `export {};` to be recognized as modules
  - Shared package exports should use both `types` and `default` fields in package.json exports for proper TypeScript support
  - TypeScript path aliases in tsconfig.json use relative paths from the tsconfig.json location
  - Turborepo automatically builds all packages in workspaces when running `yarn build`
  - Package name should use scoped format `@subscriber-nest/shared` for monorepo packages
---

## 2026-01-18 16:15 - US-003

- Installed and configured NestJS Schedule module in worker service
- Added `ScheduleModule.forRoot()` import to `apps/worker/src/app.module.ts`
- Verified `@nestjs/schedule@^6.1.0` was already installed in `apps/worker/package.json` (from US-015)
- Schedule module is now properly initialized and ready for cron job decorators
- Files changed:
  - `apps/worker/src/app.module.ts` - Added ScheduleModule import and configuration
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `@nestjs/schedule@^6.1.0` is already installed in worker service (installed in US-015)
  - `ScheduleModule.forRoot()` must be imported in AppModule imports array to enable cron decorators
  - Schedule module initialization is simple - just add `ScheduleModule.forRoot()` to imports
  - No additional configuration needed for basic cron job functionality
  - Use `yarn workspace worker typecheck` and `turbo run lint --filter=worker` to verify schedule module configuration
  - Schedule module enables `@Cron()` decorator for scheduling tasks in services

## 2026-01-19 - US-021
- Created `apps/worker/src/main.ts` that bootstraps NestJS application without HTTP server
- Worker service bootstraps the application and begins processing jobs from queues (subscriber-sync, billing, account-deletion)
- No `app.listen()` call - worker service doesn't need HTTP server, only processes jobs and runs cron jobs
- Added console logs to indicate worker service started successfully
- Files changed:
  - `apps/worker/src/main.ts` - Created with NestJS bootstrap configuration (no HTTP server)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Worker service main.ts is simpler than API service - no CORS, no raw body middleware, no validation pipes, no Bull Board
  - Worker service only needs `NestFactory.create(AppModule)` to bootstrap - no `app.listen()` call
  - Once bootstrapped, the worker service automatically starts processing jobs from registered queues and running cron jobs
  - Worker service doesn't need HTTP-related middleware or configuration
  - Use `yarn workspace worker typecheck`, `turbo run lint --filter=worker`, and `turbo run build --filter=worker` to verify main.ts configuration
  - Worker service can start successfully once database and Redis connections are configured
