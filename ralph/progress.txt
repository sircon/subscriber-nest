## Codebase Patterns
- TypeORM entities use `@Entity`, `@Column`, and relationship decorators (`@ManyToOne`, `@OneToMany`)
- Enums are defined at the top of entity files and exported for reuse
- Entity IDs use UUID type with `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn('uuid')`
- Migrations use DO $$ BEGIN ... EXCEPTION WHEN duplicate_object pattern for idempotent enum creation
- Foreign key relationships use `@JoinColumn({ name: 'columnName' })` with explicit column naming
- Migration files are timestamped and must be in `src/migrations/` (compiled to `dist/migrations/`)
- Use `columnExists` check pattern to make migrations idempotent: `table?.columns.find((col) => col.name === 'columnName')`
- Always run `turbo run build --filter=backend` before running migrations
- Migration command: `cd apps/backend && yarn db:migrate`

## 2026-01-18 09:33 - US-001
- Created SyncHistory entity with all required fields (id, espConnectionId, status, startedAt, completedAt, errorMessage, createdAt)
- Added SyncHistoryStatus enum with 'success' and 'failed' values
- Added @ManyToOne relationship from SyncHistory to EspConnection
- Updated EspConnection entity to include @OneToMany relationship to SyncHistory
- Created migration 1737220000000-CreateSyncHistory.ts to create sync_history table with foreign key constraint
- Made existing AddSyncStatusToEspConnection migration idempotent by adding column existence check
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/sync-history.entity.ts` - New entity file
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/esp-connection.entity.ts` - Added import and syncHistory relationship
  - `apps/backend/src/migrations/1737220000000-CreateSyncHistory.ts` - New migration file
  - `apps/backend/src/migrations/1737200000000-AddSyncStatusToEspConnection.ts` - Added idempotency check
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The data-source.ts uses `src/**/*.entity.ts` pattern to auto-discover entities
  - When adding relationships, both entities need to be updated (ManyToOne side and OneToMany side)
  - Foreign key CASCADE delete ensures sync history is removed when connection is deleted
  - Existing migrations may need idempotency fixes if database already has changes applied
  - Migration timestamps should be sequential and higher than existing migrations
