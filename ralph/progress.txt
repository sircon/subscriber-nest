## 2026-01-18 12:25:26 - US-001
- Created `BillingSubscription` entity with all required fields (id, userId, stripeCustomerId, stripeSubscriptionId, stripePriceId, status enum, currentPeriodStart, currentPeriodEnd, cancelAtPeriodEnd, canceledAt, createdAt, updatedAt)
- Added `@OneToOne` relationship from `BillingSubscription` to `User` entity
- Added inverse `@OneToOne` relationship from `User` to `BillingSubscription` entity
- Registered `BillingSubscription` entity in `AppModule` TypeOrmModule.forFeature array
- Generated migration `1768735510135-CreateBillingSubscription.ts` which creates the table with proper enum type, unique constraints, and foreign key
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/billing-subscription.entity.ts` (new)
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/user.entity.ts` (added relationship)
  - `apps/backend/src/app.module.ts` (registered entity)
  - `apps/backend/src/migrations/1768735510135-CreateBillingSubscription.ts` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeORM OneToOne relationships require `@JoinColumn` on the side that owns the foreign key (BillingSubscription side)
  - When adding new entities, must register them in `TypeOrmModule.forFeature([...])` in the module
  - Migration generation requires building the project first (`nest build`) to compile TypeScript
  - Enum types are automatically created in migrations when using TypeORM enum columns
  - Unique constraints are automatically added for `@Column({ unique: true })` decorators
---

## 2026-01-18 12:26:50 - US-002
- Created `BillingUsage` entity with all required fields (id, userId, billingPeriodStart, billingPeriodEnd, maxSubscriberCount, calculatedAmount with decimal precision 10 scale 2, stripeInvoiceId, status enum, createdAt, updatedAt)
- Added `@ManyToOne` relationship from `BillingUsage` to `User` entity
- Added inverse `@OneToMany` relationship from `User` to `BillingUsage` entity
- Added unique index on `userId` + `billingPeriodStart` using `@Index` decorator to prevent duplicate billing periods per user
- Registered `BillingUsage` entity in `AppModule` TypeOrmModule.forFeature array
- Generated migration `1768735595273-CreateBillingUsage.ts` which creates the table with proper enum type, decimal column (numeric(10,2)), unique composite index, and foreign key
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/billing-usage.entity.ts` (new)
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/user.entity.ts` (added relationship)
  - `apps/backend/src/app.module.ts` (registered entity)
  - `apps/backend/src/migrations/1768735595273-CreateBillingUsage.ts` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeORM decimal columns use `type: 'decimal'` with `precision` and `scale` options, which generates `numeric(precision, scale)` in PostgreSQL
  - Composite unique indexes are created using `@Index(['field1', 'field2'], { unique: true })` decorator at the entity class level
  - TypeORM ManyToOne relationships require `@JoinColumn` on the side that owns the foreign key (BillingUsage side)
  - Migration generation automatically creates enum types, foreign key constraints, and indexes based on entity decorators
---

## 2026-01-19 - US-003
- Installed `stripe` npm package (v20.2.0) in backend
- Added `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` environment variables to `.env.example`
- Created `StripeService` with initialization of Stripe client using ConfigService
- Service validates both Stripe keys are configured on initialization (fail-fast pattern)
- Service provides `getClient()` method to access Stripe instance and `getWebhookSecret()` method for webhook verification
- Registered `StripeService` in `AppModule` providers array
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/package.json` (added stripe dependency)
  - `apps/backend/.env.example` (added Stripe environment variables)
  - `apps/backend/src/services/stripe.service.ts` (new)
  - `apps/backend/src/app.module.ts` (registered service)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Stripe API version must match the version supported by the installed stripe package (currently '2025-12-15.clover')
  - Services that require environment variables should validate them in constructor using fail-fast pattern (throw error if missing)
  - Use `ConfigService` from `@nestjs/config` to read environment variables (already configured globally in AppModule)
  - Stripe client initialization requires secret key, webhook secret is stored separately for webhook signature verification
---

## 2026-01-18 12:29:01 - US-004
- Added `createCustomer(email: string, userId: string): Promise<Stripe.Customer>` method to `StripeService`
- Method creates Stripe customer with email and metadata containing userId
- Method returns Stripe customer object
- Implemented error handling: catches Stripe API errors and wraps them in `InternalServerErrorException` with descriptive messages
- Added import for `InternalServerErrorException` from `@nestjs/common`
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/services/stripe.service.ts` (added createCustomer method)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Stripe errors are instances of `Stripe.errors.StripeError` and can be caught and handled appropriately
  - Use `InternalServerErrorException` from `@nestjs/common` for external API errors (following pattern from other services)
  - Stripe customer metadata is useful for linking Stripe customers to internal user IDs
  - Always wrap external API calls in try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully
---

## 2026-01-19 - US-005
- Added `STRIPE_PRICE_ID` environment variable to `.env.example` for metered billing price configuration
- Implemented `createSubscription(customerId: string): Promise<Stripe.Subscription>` method in `StripeService`
- Method creates Stripe subscription with monthly billing cycle using price ID from environment
- Subscription uses metered billing (usage-based pricing) via the configured price ID
- Implemented `cancelSubscription(subscriptionId: string, cancelAtPeriodEnd: boolean): Promise<Stripe.Subscription>` method
- Method supports both immediate cancellation and cancellation at period end based on `cancelAtPeriodEnd` parameter
- Implemented `getSubscription(subscriptionId: string): Promise<Stripe.Subscription>` method to retrieve subscription details
- All methods include proper error handling with `InternalServerErrorException` for Stripe API errors
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/.env.example` (added STRIPE_PRICE_ID)
  - `apps/backend/src/services/stripe.service.ts` (added createSubscription, cancelSubscription, getSubscription methods)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Stripe subscriptions for metered billing require a price ID configured in environment variables
  - For monthly billing, Stripe automatically handles billing cycles - no need to set `billing_cycle_anchor` explicitly
  - Stripe subscription cancellation can be immediate (`subscriptions.cancel()`) or at period end (`subscriptions.update()` with `cancel_at_period_end: true`)
  - When creating subscriptions, the price ID must be configured in Stripe Dashboard with `usage_type: 'metered'` for usage-based pricing
  - Stripe subscription creation only requires `customer` and `items` with `price` - billing cycle is determined by the price configuration
---

## 2026-01-19 - US-006
- Created `BillingCalculationService` with `calculateAmount(subscriberCount: number): number` method
- Implemented tiered pricing logic: $5 for first 10,000 subscribers, then $1 per each additional 10,000 subscribers
- Method handles edge cases: returns $0 for 0 or negative subscribers, handles very large numbers correctly
- Method rounds to 2 decimal places to handle floating point precision issues
- Registered `BillingCalculationService` in `AppModule` providers array
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/services/billing-calculation.service.ts` (new)
  - `apps/backend/src/app.module.ts` (registered service)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Services that don't require dependencies (like calculation services) can be simple `@Injectable()` classes without constructor injection
  - When implementing tiered pricing, use `Math.ceil()` to round up to the next tier (e.g., 15,001 subscribers should be charged for 2 additional tiers)
  - Always handle edge cases (0, negative numbers) explicitly in calculation methods
  - Round monetary calculations to 2 decimal places to avoid floating point precision issues
---

## 2026-01-18 12:33:03 - US-007
- Created `BillingUsageService` with `updateUsage(userId: string, currentSubscriberCount: number): Promise<void>` method
- Method finds or creates `BillingUsage` record for current billing period (calendar month)
- Method updates `maxSubscriberCount` if current count is higher than stored max
- Billing period calculation: uses `getCurrentBillingPeriod()` helper to get first day of month (00:00:00) and last day of month (23:59:59.999)
- Method calculates billing amount using `BillingCalculationService.calculateAmount()` with max subscriber count
- Method updates `calculatedAmount` field with calculated amount
- Registered `BillingUsageService` in `AppModule` providers array
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/services/billing-usage.service.ts` (new)
  - `apps/backend/src/app.module.ts` (registered service)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Calendar month billing periods: use `new Date(year, month, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)` for start and `new Date(year, month + 1, 0, 23, 59, 59, 999)` for end (last day of month)
  - When finding billing usage records, query by `userId` and `billingPeriodStart` to leverage the unique index
  - When updating max subscriber count, only update if current count is higher (track maximum, not current)
  - Always recalculate `calculatedAmount` after updating `maxSubscriberCount` to keep billing amounts in sync
  - New billing usage records should be created with `status: BillingUsageStatus.PENDING` (will be updated to 'invoiced' when billed)
---

## 2026-01-19 - US-008
- Created `BillingProcessor` that extends BullMQ `WorkerHost` to process monthly billing jobs
- Added `billing` queue to `AppModule` with retry configuration (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
- Added `createInvoiceItem()` and `createAndFinalizeInvoice()` methods to `StripeService` for invoice management
- Created `BillingSchedulerService` that implements `OnModuleInit` to schedule monthly billing job on app startup
- Scheduled job runs on 1st day of each month at 00:00 UTC using BullMQ repeatable jobs with cron pattern `0 0 1 * *`
- Processor finds all users with active subscriptions and processes billing for each user
- For each user: retrieves `BillingUsage` for previous month, creates Stripe invoice item, finalizes invoice, updates usage record with `stripeInvoiceId` and `status: 'invoiced'`, creates new `BillingUsage` record for current month
- Processor calculates billing period dynamically (previous month) when job runs
- Error handling: logs errors per user but continues processing other users, updates usage status to 'failed' on invoice errors, re-throws errors for BullMQ retry handling
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/app.module.ts` (added billing queue, registered processor and scheduler service)
  - `apps/backend/src/services/stripe.service.ts` (added createInvoiceItem, createAndFinalizeInvoice methods)
  - `apps/backend/src/processors/billing.processor.ts` (new)
  - `apps/backend/src/services/billing-scheduler.service.ts` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - BullMQ repeatable jobs use `repeat: { pattern: 'cron-pattern', tz: 'UTC' }` option when adding jobs
  - Use `getRepeatableJobs()` to check if a repeatable job already exists before scheduling to avoid duplicates
  - For monthly billing jobs, calculate billing period dates dynamically in the processor based on when the job runs (not when scheduled)
  - When processing multiple users in a job, wrap each user's processing in try-catch to continue with other users if one fails
  - Stripe invoice items require amounts in cents (multiply dollars by 100), invoices are created with `auto_advance: true` to automatically finalize
  - Use `BillingUsageService.updateUsage()` to create new billing usage records for current month after processing previous month
  - Check `job.attemptsMade >= maxAttempts` to detect final retry attempt for logging permanent failures
---

## 2026-01-19 - US-009
- Created `BillingSubscriptionService` to handle database operations for `BillingSubscription` entity
- Service provides methods: `findByUserId()`, `findByStripeCustomerId()`, `findByStripeSubscriptionId()`, `create()`, `update()`, `updateByStripeSubscriptionId()`, `syncFromStripe()`, `hasActiveSubscription()`
- Created `BillingController` with `POST /billing/webhook` endpoint
- Endpoint verifies Stripe webhook signature using `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and raw body
- Configured NestJS app to preserve raw body for `/billing/webhook` route using `express.raw({ type: 'application/json' })`
- Handles webhook events: `customer.subscription.created`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed`
- For subscription events: syncs subscription data from Stripe to `BillingSubscription` entity (status, period dates, cancellation flags)
- For invoice events: updates `BillingUsage` records with payment status (`PAID` or `FAILED`)
- Added methods to `BillingUsageService`: `findByStripeInvoiceId()`, `updateStatus()`, `updateStatusByInvoiceId()`
- Endpoint returns 200 status for successful processing, handles errors gracefully with logging
- Registered `BillingController` and `BillingSubscriptionService` in `AppModule`
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/services/billing-subscription.service.ts` (new)
  - `apps/backend/src/services/billing-usage.service.ts` (added invoice status update methods)
  - `apps/backend/src/controllers/billing.controller.ts` (new)
  - `apps/backend/src/main.ts` (configured raw body middleware for webhook endpoint)
  - `apps/backend/src/app.module.ts` (registered controller and service)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Stripe webhook signature verification requires raw body (Buffer), not parsed JSON
  - Configure NestJS to preserve raw body for webhook routes using `express.raw({ type: 'application/json' })` middleware before JSON parsing
  - Stripe subscription properties like `current_period_start` and `current_period_end` are Unix timestamps (seconds), need to multiply by 1000 for JavaScript Date
  - Stripe TypeScript types may not include all properties - use type assertions `(stripeSubscription as any).property` when accessing properties that exist in API but not in types
  - When syncing Stripe data, try to find existing subscription by Stripe subscription ID first, then by customer ID, then create new if not found
  - For webhook handlers, always verify signature first, then process events, and return 200 even for unhandled event types (to acknowledge receipt)
  - Use Logger from `@nestjs/common` for structured logging in controllers
  - When updating entities from webhooks, handle cases where entity might not exist yet (create vs update logic)
---

## 2026-01-19 - US-010
- Added `POST /billing/create-checkout-session` endpoint to `BillingController`
- Endpoint requires authentication using `@UseGuards(AuthGuard)` and `@CurrentUser()` decorator
- Endpoint checks if user already has a Stripe customer (via `BillingSubscription`), creates new customer if needed
- Created `createCheckoutSession()` method in `StripeService` to create Stripe Checkout sessions
- Checkout session configured with success URL: `/dashboard/settings?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` and cancel URL: `/onboarding/stripe?canceled=true`
- Checkout session includes customer email from authenticated user
- Added `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable to `.env.example` for configuring redirect URLs
- Endpoint returns `{ url: string }` with checkout session URL
- Proper error handling with logging and `InternalServerErrorException` for Stripe API errors
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/.env.example` (added FRONTEND_URL)
  - `apps/backend/src/services/stripe.service.ts` (added createCheckoutSession method)
  - `apps/backend/src/controllers/billing.controller.ts` (added createCheckoutSession endpoint)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Stripe Checkout sessions require a price ID configured in environment variables (same as subscriptions)
  - When creating checkout sessions, use `mode: 'subscription'` for subscription-based checkout
  - Stripe Checkout success URLs can include `{CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}` placeholder which Stripe will replace with actual session ID
  - Always check if user already has a Stripe customer before creating a new one to avoid duplicate customers
  - When creating a new Stripe customer during checkout, also create or update the `BillingSubscription` record with the customer ID
  - Use `ConfigService` to read frontend URL from environment for constructing redirect URLs
  - Stripe Checkout sessions return a `url` property that should be returned to the frontend for redirecting the user
---

## 2026-01-19 - US-011
- Added `createPortalSession(customerId: string, returnUrl: string): Promise<Stripe.BillingPortal.Session>` method to `StripeService`
- Method creates Stripe Customer Portal session using `stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create()` API
- Added `POST /billing/create-portal-session` endpoint to `BillingController`
- Endpoint requires authentication using `@UseGuards(AuthGuard)` and `@CurrentUser()` decorator
- Endpoint validates user has active Stripe customer by checking `BillingSubscription` record
- Endpoint throws `BadRequestException` if user does not have a Stripe customer
- Portal session return URL configured to `/dashboard/settings` using `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
- Endpoint returns `{ url: string }` with portal session URL
- Proper error handling with logging and appropriate exception types (`BadRequestException`, `InternalServerErrorException`)
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/services/stripe.service.ts` (added createPortalSession method)
  - `apps/backend/src/controllers/billing.controller.ts` (added createPortalSession endpoint)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Stripe Customer Portal sessions are created using `stripe.billingPortal.sessions.create()` API (not checkout sessions)
  - Portal sessions require a `customer` ID and `return_url` for redirecting after the user finishes managing their subscription
  - Always validate that user has a Stripe customer before creating portal session to avoid Stripe API errors
  - Portal sessions allow users to manage payment methods, view invoices, and cancel subscriptions directly in Stripe's hosted portal
  - Use `BadRequestException` for client errors (missing customer) and `InternalServerErrorException` for Stripe API errors
  - Portal session URLs are returned in the same format as checkout session URLs (`{ url: string }`)
---

## 2026-01-19 - US-012
- Added `GET /billing/status` endpoint to `BillingController`
- Endpoint requires authentication using `@UseGuards(AuthGuard)` and `@CurrentUser()` decorator
- Endpoint returns `{ hasActiveSubscription: boolean, subscription: BillingSubscription | null, currentPeriodEnd: Date | null }`
- `hasActiveSubscription` is true if subscription status is 'active' and not canceled at period end
- Returns subscription details if exists, null otherwise
- Returns 401 if not authenticated (handled automatically by AuthGuard)
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/controllers/billing.controller.ts` (added getBillingStatus endpoint and Get import)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GET endpoints in NestJS use `@Get()` decorator (not `@Post()`)
  - When returning entity objects from endpoints, TypeORM entities are automatically serialized to JSON
  - The `hasActiveSubscription` logic checks both status === ACTIVE and !cancelAtPeriodEnd to ensure subscription is truly active
  - AuthGuard automatically returns 401 Unauthorized if authentication fails, no need to handle it explicitly in the endpoint
  - When checking subscription status, return the full subscription object so frontend can access all subscription details if needed
---

## 2026-01-18 12:42:22 - US-013
- Added `GET /billing/usage` endpoint to `BillingController`
- Endpoint requires authentication using `@UseGuards(AuthGuard)` and `@CurrentUser()` decorator
- Endpoint returns current month's `BillingUsage` record with: `maxSubscriberCount`, `calculatedAmount`, `billingPeriodStart`, `billingPeriodEnd`
- If no usage record exists for current month, endpoint counts current subscribers across all user's ESP connections and creates a new usage record using `BillingUsageService.updateUsage()`
- Added `getCurrentUsage(userId: string)` method to `BillingUsageService` to retrieve current month's billing usage
- Endpoint uses `In()` from TypeORM to query subscribers across multiple ESP connections efficiently
- Returns 401 if not authenticated (handled automatically by AuthGuard)
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/controllers/billing.controller.ts` (added getCurrentUsage endpoint, injected EspConnection and Subscriber repositories)
  - `apps/backend/src/services/billing-usage.service.ts` (added getCurrentUsage method)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `In()` from TypeORM to query records where a field matches any value in an array (e.g., `where: { espConnectionId: In(connectionIds) }`)
  - When counting subscribers across multiple ESP connections, first get all connection IDs for the user, then use `In()` to count subscribers
  - The `BillingUsageService.updateUsage()` method already handles creating new records if they don't exist, so it can be reused for initialization
  - When returning decimal values from TypeORM entities, convert to number using `Number()` to ensure proper JSON serialization (TypeORM returns decimals as strings)
  - Always check if usage record exists before creating, to avoid unnecessary database operations
---

## 2026-01-18 12:43:31 - US-014
- Added `GET /billing/history` endpoint to `BillingController`
- Endpoint requires authentication using `@UseGuards(AuthGuard)` and `@CurrentUser()` decorator
- Endpoint accepts optional query parameter `limit` (default: 12) using `@Query('limit')` decorator
- Endpoint validates limit is a positive number, throws `BadRequestException` if invalid
- Added `getBillingHistory(userId: string, limit: number = 12)` method to `BillingUsageService` to retrieve past billing usage records
- Service method queries `BillingUsage` records ordered by `billingPeriodStart` DESC with limit
- Endpoint returns array of past `BillingUsage` records with: `billingPeriodStart`, `billingPeriodEnd`, `maxSubscriberCount`, `calculatedAmount`, `status`, `stripeInvoiceId`
- Returns 401 if not authenticated (handled automatically by AuthGuard)
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/controllers/billing.controller.ts` (added getBillingHistory endpoint, added Query import)
  - `apps/backend/src/services/billing-usage.service.ts` (added getBillingHistory method)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `@Query('paramName')` decorator to access query parameters in NestJS controllers
  - Query parameters are strings by default, need to parse to numbers using `parseInt(value, 10)`
  - Always validate query parameters (check for NaN, negative values, etc.) before using them
  - Use `order: { field: 'DESC' }` in TypeORM queries to order results descending
  - Use `take: limit` in TypeORM queries to limit the number of results returned
  - When mapping entity results to response DTOs, convert decimal fields using `Number()` for proper JSON serialization
  - Default parameter values in TypeScript methods (e.g., `limit: number = 12`) provide fallback values if parameter is undefined
---

## 2026-01-18 12:44:46 - US-015
- Created `SubscriptionGuard` that implements `CanActivate` interface
- Guard checks if user has active subscription using `BillingSubscriptionService.findByUserId()`
- Guard allows access if subscription status is `ACTIVE` and `cancelAtPeriodEnd` is false
- Guard allows access if subscription is `CANCELED` but `currentPeriodEnd` is in the future (grace period)
- Guard throws `ForbiddenException` with message "Active subscription required" if subscription is inactive or doesn't exist
- Applied guard to `POST /esp-connections/:id/sync` endpoint using `@UseGuards(SubscriptionGuard)` decorator
- Applied guard to `GET /esp-connections/:id/subscribers/export` endpoint using `@UseGuards(SubscriptionGuard)` decorator
- Registered `SubscriptionGuard` in `AppModule` providers array
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/guards/subscription.guard.ts` (new)
  - `apps/backend/src/controllers/esp-connection.controller.ts` (added SubscriptionGuard import and applied to sync and export endpoints)
  - `apps/backend/src/app.module.ts` (registered SubscriptionGuard in providers)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Guards that use dependency injection (like `BillingSubscriptionService`) must be registered in module providers
  - Guards can be applied at the controller level (affects all routes) or at the method level (affects specific routes)
  - When applying multiple guards, use `@UseGuards(Guard1, Guard2)` - guards execute in order
  - Guards access the request object via `context.switchToHttp().getRequest()` to get the authenticated user (set by AuthGuard)
  - For grace period logic, check if subscription is canceled but `currentPeriodEnd` is in the future (allows access during remaining billing period)
  - Always check if user exists in guard (even though AuthGuard should have set it) as a safety measure
  - Use `ForbiddenException` from `@nestjs/common` for authorization failures (403 status)
---

## 2026-01-18 12:46:19 - US-016
- Updated `SubscriberSyncService.syncSubscribers()` method to track billing usage after successful sync
- After processing all subscribers, method counts total subscribers across all user's ESP connections using `In()` from TypeORM
- Method calls `BillingUsageService.updateUsage(userId, totalSubscriberCount)` to update billing usage
- Billing usage update happens after all subscribers are processed, even if some individual subscribers fail to process
- Injected `BillingUsageService` and `Subscriber` repository into `SubscriberSyncService` constructor
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/services/subscriber-sync.service.ts` (added billing usage tracking)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When updating billing usage after sync, get userId from espConnection and count subscribers across all user's ESP connections
  - Use `In()` from TypeORM to efficiently count subscribers across multiple ESP connections: `where: { espConnectionId: In(connectionIds) }`
  - Billing usage update should happen after all subscribers are processed, not during individual subscriber processing
  - The `BillingUsageService.updateUsage()` method tracks the maximum subscriber count for the current billing period, so it's safe to call after each sync
---

## 2026-01-18 12:47:48 - US-017
- Created Stripe onboarding page at `src/app/onboarding/stripe/page.tsx`
- Page displays heading "Connect your payment method" with description explaining usage-based billing model ($5 for first 10,000 subscribers, then $1 per each additional 10,000 subscribers per month)
- Added "Connect Stripe" button that calls `POST /billing/create-checkout-session` endpoint
- On success, redirects user to Stripe Checkout URL using `window.location.href`
- Handles canceled checkout case: checks for `canceled=true` query parameter and displays message allowing retry
- Page handles loading and error states with appropriate UI feedback
- Uses shadcn components (Button, Card with CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent)
- Wrapped form component in Suspense boundary to handle `useSearchParams()` requirement
- Added billing API functions to `src/lib/api.ts`: `createCheckoutSession()`, `createPortalSession()`, `getBillingStatus()`, `getCurrentUsage()`, `getBillingHistory()` with proper TypeScript types
- Files changed:
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/onboarding/stripe/page.tsx` (new)
  - `apps/frontend/src/lib/api.ts` (added billingApi namespace with all billing functions)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When using `useSearchParams()` in client components, wrap the component in a Suspense boundary to avoid build errors
  - Stripe Checkout redirects are handled by setting `window.location.href` to the checkout URL (full page navigation)
  - Cancel URLs from Stripe Checkout include query parameters that can be checked with `useSearchParams()`
  - Billing API functions follow the same pattern as other API namespaces (authApi, espConnectionApi) with token and onUnauthorized callback
  - When creating API client functions, define TypeScript interfaces for all request/response types at the top of the file
  - Suspense fallback should match the structure of the actual component for better UX during loading
---

## 2026-01-19 - US-018
- Updated `api-key/page.tsx` to redirect to `/onboarding/stripe` after ESP connection creation (instead of completing onboarding immediately)
- Removed `completeOnboarding` call and `login` context update from API key step
- Updated `auth.service.ts` `completeOnboarding` method to check for active subscription using `BillingSubscriptionService.hasActiveSubscription()` before marking user as onboarded
- Method throws `BadRequestException` with message "Active subscription required to complete onboarding" if no active subscription exists
- Injected `BillingSubscriptionService` into `AuthService` constructor (service already registered in AppModule)
- Middleware already allows access to `/onboarding/stripe` for authenticated but not onboarded users (route starts with `/onboarding` which is in `onboardingRoutes` array)
- Removed unused imports (`authApi`, `login` from useAuth) from api-key page
- Files changed:
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/onboarding/api-key/page.tsx` (updated redirect logic, removed onboarding completion)
  - `apps/backend/src/auth.service.ts` (added subscription check to completeOnboarding)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When updating onboarding flow, ensure middleware route patterns match (routes starting with `/onboarding` are automatically allowed for authenticated but not onboarded users)
  - Services must be registered in module providers before they can be injected into other services
  - Use `BadRequestException` for business logic validation errors (like missing subscription requirement)
  - When removing functionality from a component, remember to remove unused imports to avoid lint errors
  - The onboarding completion endpoint should validate all prerequisites (like active subscription) before marking user as onboarded
---

## 2026-01-19 - US-019
- Created billing settings page at `apps/frontend/src/app/dashboard/settings/billing/page.tsx`
- Page displays current month usage card showing max subscriber count, calculated amount, and billing period dates
- Page displays subscription status card showing subscription status, current period end date, and cancel at period end flag (if applicable)
- Added "Manage Subscription" and "View Invoices" buttons that open Stripe Customer Portal (both use the same portal session as Stripe doesn't support opening specific sections via API)
- Implemented billing history table displaying past 12 months with period dates, subscriber count, amount, status, and invoice links
- Added loading states with skeleton UI and error handling with user-friendly error messages
- Used shadcn components: Card, Table (with TableHeader, TableBody, TableRow, TableCell, TableHead), and Button
- Page fetches billing data using `billingApi.getBillingStatus()`, `billingApi.getCurrentUsage()`, and `billingApi.getBillingHistory()` on mount
- Implemented date formatting using `toLocaleDateString()` and currency formatting using `Intl.NumberFormat`
- Added status color coding for billing history items (green for paid, blue for invoiced, yellow for pending, red for failed)
- Invoice links open Stripe dashboard invoices in new tab
- Files changed:
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/dashboard/settings/billing/page.tsx` (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `Promise.all()` to fetch multiple API endpoints in parallel for better performance
  - Stripe Customer Portal doesn't support opening specific sections (like invoices) directly via API - users navigate within the portal
  - When displaying billing periods, show both start and end dates for clarity
  - Use `Intl.NumberFormat` for currency formatting to ensure proper locale-specific formatting
  - Status enums from backend are typically in snake_case (e.g., 'past_due') - format them for display using string manipulation
  - Stripe invoice IDs can be used to construct dashboard URLs: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/invoices/{invoice_id}`
  - Always handle loading and error states in data-fetching components for better UX
  - Use skeleton loaders that match the structure of the actual content for better perceived performance

## 2026-01-19 - US-020
- Verified all billing API client functions are already implemented in `apps/frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- All required functions present: `getBillingStatus()`, `getCurrentUsage()`, `getBillingHistory(limit?: number)`, `createCheckoutSession()`, `createPortalSession()`
- All functions include proper TypeScript types (interfaces defined: `BillingStatusResponse`, `CurrentUsageResponse`, `BillingHistoryItem[]`, `CreateCheckoutSessionResponse`, `CreatePortalSessionResponse`)
- All functions handle authentication tokens (accept `token: string | null` parameter)
- All functions handle 401 errors (accept `onUnauthorized?: OnUnauthorizedCallback` parameter)
- Functions follow the same pattern as other API namespaces (authApi, espConnectionApi) using the shared `apiRequest()` helper
- Typecheck passes: `yarn tsc --noEmit` in frontend directory completes successfully
- Lint passes: `turbo run lint --filter=frontend` completes successfully
- Files changed:
  - No changes needed - functions were already implemented in US-017
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When verifying story completion, check if functionality was already implemented in previous stories (billing API functions were added in US-017)
  - API client functions should follow consistent patterns across all namespaces for maintainability
  - All API functions should use the shared `apiRequest()` helper to ensure consistent error handling and authentication
  - TypeScript interfaces for API responses should be defined at the top of the API client file for easy reference
