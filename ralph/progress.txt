- Updated hero section messaging to emphasize audience safety and protection

  - HeroSection uses Shield icon from lucide-react for safety/protection messaging

## Mon Jan 19 09:01:52 CET 2026 - US-002
- Rewrote hero subheadline to emphasize audience safety and protection messaging
- Updated subheadline to: "Your audience is your most valuable asset—keep it safe. We sync daily to maintain a secure backup of your updated list. Download anytime or import to another ESP if yours has issues. Your subscribers, always protected."
- Emphasized audience as most valuable asset with safety messaging
- Included backup capability and download/import functionality
- Files changed: `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The subheadline text should be concise and impactful while covering all key value propositions
  - Safety/protection messaging works well with phrases like "keep it safe" and "always protected"
  - Auto-fixed linting issues in generated files (next-env.d.ts) don't need to be tracked separately

- Files changed: `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The pricing section features list is the appropriate place for detailed benefit messaging (not the hero features row)
  - Backup/download messaging should emphasize both the "always have a backup" safety angle and the practical "import to another ESP" benefit
  - Features are displayed as a simple array in the pricing section, making it easy to add new items

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - FAQ answers are stored in a simple array of objects with `question` and `answer` properties in the FAQSection component
  - When updating FAQ content, search for all instances of the term being removed (e.g., "trial") to ensure consistency
  - The updated answer should align with the pricing section messaging about affordability and accessibility
  - Browser verification via curl confirms the FAQ changes render correctly in the HTML output

- Files changed: `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - FAQ questions can be added to the `faqs` array in FAQSection component by inserting new objects with `question` and `answer` properties
  - When adding FAQ about backup/download, frame it as "insurance" and "protection" to emphasize safety value proposition
  - The answer should explain both the technical capability (daily sync, download, import) and the safety benefit (insurance against ESP issues)
  - Browser verification via curl confirms the new FAQ question and answer render correctly in the HTML output
