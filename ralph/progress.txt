## 2026-01-18 15:18 - US-001
- Created shared package directory structure at `packages/shared/src/` with all required subdirectories (entities, dto, services, events, interfaces, types)
- Updated root `package.json` to include `packages/*` in workspaces configuration
- Fixed linting error in `apps/frontend/next-env.d.ts` (prettier quote style)
- Files changed:
  - `package.json` - Added `packages/*` to workspaces
  - `apps/frontend/next-env.d.ts` - Fixed quote style for linting
  - Created directory structure: `packages/shared/src/{entities,dto,services,events,interfaces,types}/`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Empty directories are not tracked by git until files are added (this is expected behavior)
  - Root `package.json` workspaces must include both `apps/*` and `packages/*` for monorepo structure
  - Turborepo automatically recognizes new workspaces once added to root package.json
  - Use `yarn lint` and `yarn build` to verify changes don't break existing code

## 2026-01-18 15:25 - US-002
- Created `packages/shared/package.json` with name `@subscriber-nest/shared`, version, and proper exports configuration for all subdirectories (entities, dto, services, events, interfaces, types)
- Created `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` with TypeScript configuration matching backend settings (commonjs, ES2022 target, decorators enabled)
- Created index.ts files for all subdirectories with empty exports to make them valid TypeScript modules
- Configured TypeScript paths in `apps/backend/tsconfig.json` to include `@subscriber-nest/shared` and `@subscriber-nest/shared/*` aliases pointing to `../../packages/shared/src`
- Root `package.json` already had `packages/*` in workspaces from US-001
- Files changed:
  - `packages/shared/package.json` - Created with exports configuration
  - `packages/shared/tsconfig.json` - Created with TypeScript config
  - `packages/shared/src/index.ts` - Main entry point
  - `packages/shared/src/{entities,dto,services,events,interfaces,types}/index.ts` - Subdirectory entry points
  - `apps/backend/tsconfig.json` - Added path aliases for shared package
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Empty TypeScript files need `export {};` to be recognized as modules
  - Shared package exports should use both `types` and `default` fields in package.json exports for proper TypeScript support
  - TypeScript path aliases in tsconfig.json use relative paths from the tsconfig.json location
  - Turborepo automatically builds all packages in workspaces when running `yarn build`
  - Package name should use scoped format `@subscriber-nest/shared` for monorepo packages
