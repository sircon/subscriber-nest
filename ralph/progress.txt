## Codebase Patterns
- TypeORM entities are automatically loaded via `autoLoadEntities: true` in TypeOrmModule configuration
- Migration files go in `src/migrations/` and are compiled to `dist/migrations/` for execution
- Use `yarn build` before running migrations to ensure compiled files exist
- Entity files use TypeORM decorators: `@Entity()`, `@Column()`, `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn()`, `@CreateDateColumn()`, `@UpdateDateColumn()`
- Foreign key relationships use `@ManyToOne()` and `@JoinColumn()` decorators
- Use `uuid` type for primary keys with `uuid_generate_v4()` default in migrations

## 2026-01-17 - US-001
- Created User, VerificationCode, and Session entities with all required fields
- Created migration file to create the three tables with proper relationships
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/user.entity.ts` - User entity with email (unique), isOnboarded, timestamps
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/verification-code.entity.ts` - VerificationCode entity with 6-digit code, expiration, and used flag
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/session.entity.ts` - Session entity with token, userId foreign key, expiration
  - `apps/backend/src/migrations/1737000000000-CreateUserAndSessionEntities.ts` - Migration to create all three tables
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeORM CLI path issue in yarn workspaces - migration generation failed, so created migration manually
  - Migration format: class implements `MigrationInterface` with `up()` and `down()` methods using `queryRunner.query()`
  - Use `uuid_generate_v4()` for UUID defaults in PostgreSQL migrations
  - Foreign keys should use `ON DELETE CASCADE` for sessions when user is deleted
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
