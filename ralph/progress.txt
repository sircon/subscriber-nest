## Mon Jan 19 08:59:49 CET 2026 - US-001
- Updated hero section messaging to emphasize audience safety and protection
- Changed headline from "Your subscribers, always accessible" to "Keep your audience safe and backed up"
- Updated subheadline to emphasize subscribers as most valuable asset, mention daily sync, backup capability, and ability to import if ESP has issues
- Changed CTA button from "Get Started Free" to "Get Started"
- Removed "No credit card required" text and replaced with "Credit card required to start"
- Updated badge from "Sync subscribers in seconds" to "Protect your most valuable asset" (changed icon from Zap to Shield)
- Files changed: `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The homepage is a single file component at `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` with all sections (HeroSection, PricingSection, FAQSection) defined inline
  - HeroSection uses Shield icon from lucide-react for safety/protection messaging
  - Prettier auto-formatting will fix line breaks in long text strings automatically when running `yarn lint --fix`
  - The dev server runs on port 3000 and can be verified by checking the HTML output
  - All changes must pass both TypeScript typecheck (via `turbo run build --filter=frontend`) and ESLint (via `turbo run lint --filter=frontend`)
