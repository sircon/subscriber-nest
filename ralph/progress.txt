## Codebase Patterns
- TypeORM entities are automatically loaded via `autoLoadEntities: true` in TypeOrmModule configuration
- Migration files go in `src/migrations/` and are compiled to `dist/migrations/` for execution
- Use `yarn build` before running migrations to ensure compiled files exist
- Entity files use TypeORM decorators: `@Entity()`, `@Column()`, `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn()`, `@CreateDateColumn()`, `@UpdateDateColumn()`
- Foreign key relationships use `@ManyToOne()` and `@JoinColumn()` decorators
- Use `uuid` type for primary keys with `uuid_generate_v4()` default in migrations

## 2026-01-17 - US-001
- Created User, VerificationCode, and Session entities with all required fields
- Created migration file to create the three tables with proper relationships
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/user.entity.ts` - User entity with email (unique), isOnboarded, timestamps
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/verification-code.entity.ts` - VerificationCode entity with 6-digit code, expiration, and used flag
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/session.entity.ts` - Session entity with token, userId foreign key, expiration
  - `apps/backend/src/migrations/1737000000000-CreateUserAndSessionEntities.ts` - Migration to create all three tables
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeORM CLI path issue in yarn workspaces - migration generation failed, so created migration manually
  - Migration format: class implements `MigrationInterface` with `up()` and `down()` methods using `queryRunner.query()`
  - Use `uuid_generate_v4()` for UUID defaults in PostgreSQL migrations
  - Foreign keys should use `ON DELETE CASCADE` for sessions when user is deleted
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-002
- Created EspConnection entity with provider enum, apiKey field, and relationship to User
- Added OneToMany relationship from User to EspConnections
- Created migration to create esp_connections table with enum type and foreign key
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/esp-connection.entity.ts` - EspConnection entity with provider enum (kit, beehiiv, mailchimp), apiKey, isActive, timestamps
  - `apps/backend/src/entities/user.entity.ts` - Added OneToMany relationship to EspConnections
  - `apps/backend/src/migrations/1737000001000-CreateEspConnectionEntity.ts` - Migration to create esp_connections table and esp_provider_enum type
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeORM enum columns require creating the enum type in PostgreSQL migrations before using it in table creation
  - Use `@OneToMany()` decorator on the parent entity (User) and `@ManyToOne()` on the child entity (EspConnection)
  - API key encryption will be handled in the service layer (stored as text in DB for now)
  - Enum values in TypeORM are defined as a TypeScript enum and referenced in the Column decorator
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-003
- Set up Resend email service with EmailService class
- Installed `resend` package (not `@resend/node`)
- Updated .env.example with placeholder RESEND_API_KEY and documentation
- Created EmailService with sendVerificationCode method that uses Resend API
- Added EmailService to AppModule providers and exports
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/package.json` - Added resend dependency
  - `apps/backend/.env.example` - Added RESEND_API_KEY with placeholder and documentation
  - `apps/backend/src/email.service.ts` - New EmailService class with Resend integration
  - `apps/backend/src/app.module.ts` - Added EmailService to providers and exports
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Resend package name is `resend`, not `@resend/node`
  - EmailService uses ConfigService to read RESEND_API_KEY from environment
  - Service throws error on initialization if RESEND_API_KEY is missing (fail-fast pattern)
  - EmailService is exported from AppModule so it can be injected into other modules
  - Basic HTML email template included in service (will be replaced with react-email template in US-004)
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-004
- Created react-email verification code template with professional styling
- Installed react-email, @react-email/components, react, and react-dom packages
- Created VerificationCodeEmail component in apps/backend/src/emails/verification-code-email.tsx

  - `apps/backend/src/email.service.ts` - Updated to use react-email template rendering
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - react-email requires React and react-dom to be installed even in backend projects
  - Use `render` from `@react-email/render` with `React.createElement` to render templates to HTML
  - Template components use JSX syntax, so TypeScript config needs `"jsx": "react"` option
  - react-email templates compile to JavaScript and are included in the build output
  - Use `{ pretty: true }` option in render() for formatted HTML output
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully

  - Use `MoreThan()` from TypeORM to query records created after a specific date for rate limiting
  - BadRequestException from @nestjs/common is appropriate for client errors (rate limiting, invalid email)
  - Rate limiting checks count of codes created in the last hour using `createdAt: MoreThan(oneHourAgo)`
  - Code generation uses `Math.floor(100000 + Math.random() * 900000)` to ensure exactly 6 digits
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-006
- Created POST /auth/verify-code endpoint that validates codes and creates sessions
- Implemented verifyCode method in AuthService that validates code, creates/finds user, marks code as used, and creates session
- Endpoint returns token and user information on success
- Files changed:

  - Session tokens are generated using `crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex')` for secure random tokens
  - Always mark verification codes as used after successful verification to prevent reuse
  - User creation happens automatically during code verification if user doesn't exist (with isOnboarded: false)
  - Use `findOne()` with `where` clause to find entities by specific fields
  - Session expiration is set to 30 days from creation (configurable in verifyCode method)
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-007
- Created AuthGuard that validates session tokens from request headers
- Guard implements CanActivate interface and checks token in Authorization header (Bearer format)
- Guard validates token exists in database, is not expired, and loads user
- Created CurrentUser decorator to access authenticated user in controllers
- Guard can be applied to controllers/routes via @UseGuards(AuthGuard)
- Returns 401 UnauthorizedException if token invalid, missing, or expired
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/guards/auth.guard.ts` - New AuthGuard class with session validation logic
  - `apps/backend/src/decorators/current-user.decorator.ts` - New CurrentUser decorator to extract user from request
  - `apps/backend/src/app.module.ts` - Added AuthGuard to providers
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Guards in NestJS implement `CanActivate` interface with `canActivate(context: ExecutionContext)` method
  - Use `context.switchToHttp().getRequest()` to access HTTP request object
  - Extract token from Authorization header with format "Bearer <token>"
  - Use `@InjectRepository()` in guards to inject TypeORM repositories (guards need to be in providers)
  - Guards that use dependency injection must be added to module providers
  - Use `relations: ['user']` in findOne to eagerly load related entities
  - Attach user to request object (`request.user = user`) so it's available in controllers via decorators
  - Use `UnauthorizedException` from `@nestjs/common` for authentication failures
  - TypeScript requires null checking when assigning `findOne()` result (can return null)
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-008
- Created GET /auth/me endpoint protected by AuthGuard
- Endpoint returns current user information (id, email, isOnboarded)
- Uses @UseGuards(AuthGuard) and @CurrentUser() decorator to access authenticated user
- Returns 401 if not authenticated (handled by AuthGuard)
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/auth.controller.ts` - Added GET /auth/me endpoint with AuthGuard protection
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GET endpoints can be protected with @UseGuards(AuthGuard) just like POST endpoints
  - Use @CurrentUser() decorator to access the authenticated user that was attached to the request by AuthGuard
  - The endpoint simply returns the user data from the request - no additional database queries needed since AuthGuard already loaded the user
  - Response format matches the user object structure returned by verify-code endpoint for consistency
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-009
- Created POST /auth/logout endpoint protected by AuthGuard
- Implemented logout method in AuthService that deletes session from database
- Endpoint extracts token from Authorization header and deletes the session
- Returns { success: true } on successful logout
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/auth.service.ts` - Added logout method that finds and deletes session by token
  - `apps/backend/src/auth.controller.ts` - Added POST /auth/logout endpoint with AuthGuard protection
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `@Headers('authorization')` decorator from NestJS to extract Authorization header in controllers
  - Token extraction follows same pattern as AuthGuard: split "Bearer <token>" format
  - Logout endpoint is protected by AuthGuard to ensure only authenticated users can log out
  - Session deletion uses `sessionRepository.remove()` after finding the session by token
  - If session doesn't exist (edge case), logout still returns success to avoid leaking information
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-010
- Created POST /esp-connections endpoint protected by AuthGuard
- Implemented EncryptionService using Node's built-in crypto module with AES-256-GCM encryption

  - AES-256-GCM provides authenticated encryption (encryption + integrity verification)
  - Encryption format: `iv:authTag:encryptedData` (colon-separated hex strings)
  - EncryptionService uses ConfigService to read ENCRYPTION_KEY from environment and throws error if missing (fail-fast)
  - Convert encryption key to 32-byte buffer using SHA-256 hash for AES-256 key requirement
  - Provider validation checks against EspProvider enum values using `Object.values(EspProvider).includes()`
  - Use `BadRequestException` for invalid provider validation errors
  - API keys are encrypted before storing in database, never returned in API responses
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully

## 2026-01-17 - US-011
- Created POST /auth/complete-onboarding endpoint protected by AuthGuard
- Implemented completeOnboarding method in AuthService that sets user's isOnboarded to true
- Endpoint uses @CurrentUser() decorator to get authenticated user and updates their onboarding status
- Returns { success: true, user: { id, email, isOnboarded: true } } on success

  - `apps/backend/src/auth.service.ts` - Added completeOnboarding method that updates user's isOnboarded field
  - `apps/backend/src/auth.controller.ts` - Added POST /auth/complete-onboarding endpoint with AuthGuard protection
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - User updates use `userRepository.save()` after modifying entity properties
  - The endpoint follows the same pattern as other protected endpoints: @UseGuards(AuthGuard) and @CurrentUser() decorator
  - Response format matches the user object structure from other auth endpoints for consistency
  - User lookup by ID is performed even though @CurrentUser() provides the user, to ensure user still exists in database
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-012
- Created GET /esp-connections endpoint protected by AuthGuard
- Implemented getUserConnections method in EspConnectionService that fetches user's ESP connections

  - `apps/backend/src/esp-connection.service.ts` - Added getUserConnections method that queries connections by userId
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use `select` option in TypeORM `find()` to explicitly exclude sensitive fields like API keys from query results
  - GET endpoints follow same pattern as POST endpoints: @UseGuards(AuthGuard) and @CurrentUser() decorator
  - Service methods can use `find()` with `where` clause to filter by userId for user-specific data
  - Response format returns array of connection objects without sensitive data (API keys are never included)
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-013
- Created login page UI with email input form and verification code request functionality
- Created shadcn Input component following the same pattern as Button component
- Implemented form with loading, success, and error states
- Form calls POST /auth/send-code endpoint and redirects to /verify-code with email in query params
- Files changed:
  - `apps/frontend/src/components/ui/input.tsx` - New Input component with shadcn styling
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx` - New login page with email form, loading/success/error states, and redirect logic
  - `apps/frontend/.eslintrc.json` - Added "node": true to env and "process": "readonly" to globals to fix lint errors
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js client components can access `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables directly (replaced at build time)
  - Use `useRouter()` from `next/navigation` for client-side navigation in App Router
  - shadcn components follow a consistent pattern: forwardRef, className merging with cn(), and TypeScript interfaces extending HTML element props
  - Form state management: use useState for email, loading, error, and success states
  - Error handling: check response.ok and parse error messages from API responses
  - Redirect after success: use setTimeout with router.push() to show success message before redirecting
  - ESLint config needs "node": true in env for config files (tailwind.config.ts) and "process" in globals for client components using env vars
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
  - Page verified loading correctly in browser (dev server on port 3000)
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-014
- Created verify code page UI with 6-digit code input and verification functionality
- Page reads email from query params and redirects to login if missing
- Implemented form with loading, error states, and conditional redirects based on isOnboarded status
- Form calls POST /auth/verify-code endpoint and stores token in localStorage
- Files changed:
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/verify-code/page.tsx` - New verify code page with 6-digit input, form validation, API integration, and conditional redirects
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `useSearchParams()` must be wrapped in a Suspense boundary in Next.js App Router to avoid build errors
  - Split component into form component and page component: form uses useSearchParams(), page wraps in Suspense
  - Code input validation: use `replace(/\D/g, '')` to only allow digits, limit to 6 characters with maxLength
  - Input styling: use `text-center text-2xl tracking-widest font-mono` for code input to make digits clearly visible
  - Token storage: store in localStorage temporarily (will be moved to auth context in US-017)
  - Conditional redirects: check `data.user.isOnboarded` to redirect to /onboarding (false) or /dashboard (true)
  - Email validation: redirect to /login if email query param is missing (handled in useEffect)

  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-015
- Created onboarding provider selection page with card-based UI
- Created shadcn Card component following standard shadcn pattern
- Implemented provider selection UI showing Kit, beehiiv, and Mailchimp as clickable cards
- Each card displays provider name and description with a selection button
- On selection, redirects to /onboarding/api-key?provider={provider}
- Files changed:
  - `apps/frontend/src/components/ui/card.tsx` - New Card component with CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, and CardFooter subcomponents
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/onboarding/page.tsx` - New onboarding page with provider selection grid layout
- **Learnings for future iterations:**

  - Card subcomponents (CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, CardFooter) are separate forwardRef components for flexibility
  - Provider list is defined as a constant array with type safety using TypeScript union types
  - Grid layout uses `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3` for responsive design (1 column on mobile, 3 on desktop)
  - Card click handler and button click handler both trigger navigation (with stopPropagation on button to prevent double navigation)
  - Provider values match EspProvider enum from backend (kit, beehiiv, mailchimp) for consistency
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
  - Page verified rendering correctly in browser (dev server on port 3000)
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-016
- Created onboarding API key entry page with provider selection and API key input form
- Implemented form that reads provider from query params and displays provider name
- Form includes password-type API key input and 'Sync subscribers to vault' CTA button
- On submit, calls POST /esp-connections to save connection, then POST /auth/complete-onboarding, then redirects to /dashboard
- Added loading and error states with proper error handling
- Files changed:
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/onboarding/api-key/page.tsx` - New API key entry page with form, API integration, and conditional redirects
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - API key entry page follows same pattern as verify-code page: Suspense boundary for useSearchParams, form component with state management
  - Provider validation: redirect to /onboarding if provider is missing or invalid (handled in useEffect)
  - Token retrieval: read auth token from localStorage (stored by verify-code page) for authenticated API calls
  - Multi-step API flow: save ESP connection first, then complete onboarding, then update localStorage with new user data, then redirect
  - Error handling: check for token existence before making API calls, show user-friendly error messages
  - Form validation: check for empty API key before submission, disable button during loading
  - Card component usage: use Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, and CardContent for consistent layout
  - Suspense fallback: provide loading skeleton that matches page layout for better UX
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-017
- Created AuthContext with provider and useAuth hook for managing authentication state across the app
- Context stores: user, token, loading, isAuthenticated
- Context provides: login(token, user), logout(), checkAuth() methods
- On mount, loads token from localStorage and calls GET /auth/me to restore session
- Token stored in localStorage (can be upgraded to httpOnly cookies later)
- Updated layout to wrap app with AuthProvider
- Updated verify-code and onboarding/api-key pages to use auth context instead of localStorage directly
- Files changed:
  - `apps/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - New AuthContext provider with authentication state management
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added AuthProvider wrapper
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/verify-code/page.tsx` - Updated to use auth context login() method
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/onboarding/api-key/page.tsx` - Updated to use auth context token and login() method
  - `apps/frontend/AGENTS.md` - Added Authentication section with context usage patterns
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - React Context pattern: create context with createContext, provide via Provider component, access via custom hook (useAuth)
  - Token storage: use localStorage for now (keys: 'auth_token', 'user'), can be upgraded to httpOnly cookies for better security
  - Session restoration: on mount, load token from storage and call GET /auth/me to verify session is still valid
  - Circular dependency handling: use local variables (currentToken) in useCallback closures to avoid stale closures
  - Loading state: set loading to false when no token exists on initial load, or after checkAuth completes
  - Logout cleanup: clear token/user state, remove from localStorage, and optionally call logout endpoint to invalidate server session
  - ESLint false positive: parameter names in TypeScript type definitions trigger no-unused-vars rule - use eslint-disable comment or type aliases
  - Context provider placement: wrap app in root layout (layout.tsx) so auth state is available to all pages
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-018
- Created Next.js middleware to protect routes and redirect unauthenticated users
- Middleware checks for auth token and user data in cookies
- Implemented redirect logic: unauthenticated users accessing protected routes → /login, authenticated but not onboarded users accessing protected routes → /onboarding
- Updated AuthContext to set/clear cookies in addition to localStorage so middleware can access auth state
- Middleware allows access to /login and /verify-code without auth, and /onboarding/* if authenticated but not onboarded
- Files changed:
  - `apps/frontend/src/middleware.ts` - New Next.js middleware with route protection and redirect logic
  - `apps/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated to set/clear cookies for middleware access
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Next.js middleware runs on the edge/server and cannot access localStorage - must use cookies for auth state
  - Middleware can read cookies via `request.cookies.get()` from NextRequest
  - Use `NextResponse.redirect()` to redirect users in middleware
  - Configure middleware matcher to exclude API routes, static files, and Next.js internal routes
  - Cookies set from client-side must not be httpOnly if middleware needs to read them
  - Use `SameSite=Lax` for cookies to work with middleware redirects
  - Cookie expiration should match session expiration (30 days default)
  - Middleware runs before page rendering, so it's the first line of defense for route protection
  - Next.js shows deprecation warning about "middleware" convention (suggests using "proxy" instead), but middleware still works
  - Route matching: use `pathname.startsWith(route)` to match route prefixes (e.g., `/onboarding` matches `/onboarding/api-key`)
  - Home page (`/`) is treated as public route and doesn't require authentication
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-019
- Created dashboard page with welcome message and ESP connections display
- Page shows user email from auth context and fetches ESP connections from GET /esp-connections endpoint
- Displays connected ESPs in a grid layout using Card components
- Handles loading and error states with appropriate UI feedback
- Page is protected by middleware (already configured in US-018)
- Files changed:
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - New dashboard page with welcome message, ESP connections display, and loading/error states
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Dashboard page follows same pattern as other pages: 'use client', useAuth hook, fetch API calls with Authorization header
  - ESP connections endpoint returns array of { id, provider, isActive, createdAt } objects
  - Provider names are mapped from enum values (kit, beehiiv, mailchimp) to display names using a Record type
  - Loading state shows skeleton UI matching the final layout for better UX
  - Empty state message shown when no ESP connections exist
  - Date formatting uses `toLocaleDateString()` for user-friendly date display
  - Grid layout uses `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3` for responsive design (1 column on mobile, 3 on desktop)
  - Page automatically fetches connections on mount using useEffect with token dependency
  - Error handling displays error message in a Card with destructive styling
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully
---

## 2026-01-17 - US-020
- Created centralized API client with typed functions for all backend endpoints
- Implemented base apiRequest function that handles auth tokens, 401 errors, and automatic redirects
- Created typed functions for all auth endpoints (sendCode, verifyCode, getCurrentUser, logout, completeOnboarding)
- Created typed functions for all ESP connection endpoints (createConnection, getUserConnections)
- Updated all pages and AuthContext to use the new API client instead of direct fetch calls
- Files changed:
  - `apps/frontend/src/lib/api.ts` - New API client module with typed functions and 401 error handling
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx` - Updated to use authApi.sendCode
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/verify-code/page.tsx` - Updated to use authApi.verifyCode
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/onboarding/api-key/page.tsx` - Updated to use espConnectionApi.createConnection and authApi.completeOnboarding
  - `apps/frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Updated to use espConnectionApi.getUserConnections
  - `apps/frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Updated to use authApi.getCurrentUser and authApi.logout
  - `apps/frontend/.eslintrc.json` - Updated ESLint config to disable no-undef rule (TypeScript handles type checking)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - API client pattern: Create centralized API client with typed functions to avoid code duplication and ensure consistency
  - HeadersInit type: Use Record<string, string> for headers and cast to HeadersInit when passing to fetch to avoid TypeScript errors
  - 401 error handling: API client accepts optional onUnauthorized callback for custom handling, and automatically redirects to /login if not already there
  - Token parameter: API functions accept token as parameter (from AuthContext) rather than reading it internally, allowing flexibility
  - Type safety: Export TypeScript interfaces for all request/response types to ensure type safety across the app
  - ESLint config: Disable no-undef rule when using TypeScript (TypeScript compiler handles undefined variable checking)
  - API client functions are organized into namespaces (authApi, espConnectionApi) for better organization
  - All quality checks (typecheck, lint, build) passed successfully

  - Import path conflicts between duplicate files
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When merging branches with parallel development, expect entity schema conflicts
  - The main branch had simpler versions of ESP connection code (for onboarding UI)
  - The ESP sync branch has more complete, production-ready versions with encryption, validation, and queue processing
  - Subsequent stories will resolve these conflicts by:
    1. Keeping the ESP sync branch versions (more complete)
    2. Updating the entity to match both schemas
    3. Removing duplicate files from main branch
    4. Fixing all import paths
  - Git merge strategy: preserve both sides initially, then resolve systematically in dedicated stories
  - The merged entity includes User relationship (needed for auth) and all ESP sync fields (needed for sync functionality)

## 2026-01-18 - US-017
- Resolved EspConnection entity conflicts from merge
- Entity already contained all required fields from merge resolution in US-016
- Verified entity has proper relationships:
  - `@ManyToOne(() => User)` with `@JoinColumn({ name: 'userId' })` on EspConnection
  - `@OneToMany(() => EspConnection)` on User entity
- Verified enums are correct:
  - `EspType`: beehiiv, kit, mailchimp
  - `EspConnectionStatus`: active, invalid, error
- Removed duplicate files from main branch:
  - `src/esp-connection.controller.ts` (simple version) - kept `src/controllers/esp-connection.controller.ts` (full version)
  - `src/esp-connection.service.ts` (basic version) - kept `src/services/esp-connection.service.ts` (complete version)
  - `src/encryption.service.ts` (duplicate) - kept `src/services/encryption.service.ts` (original)
- Removed conflicting migrations:
  - Deleted `1737000001000-CreateEspConnectionEntity.ts` (simple version from main)
  - Deleted `1768693294548-AddLastSyncedAtToEspConnection.ts` (separate migration)
- Updated main migration `1737129600000-CreateEspConnectionAndSubscriber.ts`:
  - Added all ESP types to enum: beehiiv, kit, mailchimp (was only beehiiv)
  - Added `lastSyncedAt` column (was in separate migration)
  - Added foreign key from esp_connections to users table
- Files changed:
  - Deleted: `apps/backend/src/esp-connection.controller.ts`
  - Deleted: `apps/backend/src/esp-connection.service.ts`
  - Deleted: `apps/backend/src/encryption.service.ts`
  - Deleted: `apps/backend/src/migrations/1737000001000-CreateEspConnectionEntity.ts`
  - Deleted: `apps/backend/src/migrations/1768693294548-AddLastSyncedAtToEspConnection.ts`
  - Updated: `apps/backend/src/migrations/1737129600000-CreateEspConnectionAndSubscriber.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When merging branches with duplicate files, keep the more complete/production-ready version
  - The ESP sync branch versions (in services/, controllers/ subdirectories) are more feature-complete than main branch versions (in src/ root)
  - Consolidate migrations when possible - having one migration create all fields is cleaner than multiple incremental migrations
  - Update enum types in migrations to include all values from the entity definition
  - Foreign key relationships must be defined both in entities (TypeORM decorators) and migrations (createForeignKey)
  - After removing duplicate files, verify all imports in app.module.ts point to the correct remaining files
  - Typecheck is the best way to verify all conflicts are resolved and imports are correct

## 2026-01-18 - US-018
- Verified User, Session, and VerificationCode entities exist from main branch merge
- All entities have correct fields and relationships:
  - User: id (UUID), email (unique), isOnboarded (boolean, default false), createdAt, updatedAt
  - Session: id (UUID), userId (FK to User), token (unique string), expiresAt (timestamp), createdAt
  - VerificationCode: id (UUID), email, code (6-digit string), expiresAt (timestamp), used (boolean, default false), createdAt
- User entity has `@OneToMany(() => EspConnection)` relationship (verified in US-017)
- Migration `1737000000000-CreateUserAndSessionEntities.ts` creates all three tables with proper foreign key relationships
- Session table has FK constraint from userId to users(id) with CASCADE delete
- All entities properly imported in app.module.ts and registered with TypeOrmModule.forFeature()
- Typecheck passes
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This story was already completed by the merge - entities and migrations came from the main branch
  - Always verify existing code before starting implementation
  - When merging branches with parallel development, many stories may already be completed by one branch

## 2026-01-18 - US-019
- Integrated AuthGuard into all ESP Connection endpoints
- Added `@UseGuards(AuthGuard)` decorator at controller level (applies to all endpoints)
- Imported and used `@CurrentUser()` decorator from `src/decorators/current-user.decorator.ts`
- Removed all placeholder userId logic (`'placeholder-user-id'`) from all three endpoints
- Removed all TODO comments about getting userId from authentication context
- Updated GET `/api/esp-connections/:id` endpoint:
  - Added `@CurrentUser() user: User` parameter
  - Changed from `userId` to `user.id` for ownership validation
- Updated POST `/api/esp-connections` endpoint:
  - Added `@CurrentUser() user: User` parameter
  - Changed from `userId` to `user.id` for creating connection
- Updated POST `/api/esp-connections/:id/sync` endpoint:
  - Added `@CurrentUser() user: User` parameter
  - Changed from `userId` to `user.id` for ownership validation
- All endpoints now return 401 Unauthorized if authentication fails (handled by AuthGuard)
- AuthGuard validates Bearer token, checks session expiration, and attaches user to request
- Files changed:
  - `apps/backend/src/controllers/esp-connection.controller.ts` - Added auth integration
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Apply `@UseGuards()` at the controller level to protect all endpoints with one decorator
  - The `@CurrentUser()` decorator extracts the user attached to the request by AuthGuard
  - AuthGuard throws UnauthorizedException (401) automatically if token is missing, invalid, or expired
  - The user object is typed as `User` entity, so we have full type safety when accessing `user.id`
  - No need to manually check authentication in endpoints - the guard handles it before the endpoint is called
  - The pattern is: AuthGuard validates → attaches user to request → @CurrentUser() extracts user → endpoint uses user.id
