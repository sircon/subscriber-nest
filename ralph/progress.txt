## 2026-01-18 15:18 - US-001
- Created shared package directory structure at `packages/shared/src/` with all required subdirectories (entities, dto, services, events, interfaces, types)
- Updated root `package.json` to include `packages/*` in workspaces configuration
- Fixed linting error in `apps/frontend/next-env.d.ts` (prettier quote style)
- Files changed:
  - `package.json` - Added `packages/*` to workspaces
  - `apps/frontend/next-env.d.ts` - Fixed quote style for linting
  - Created directory structure: `packages/shared/src/{entities,dto,services,events,interfaces,types}/`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Empty directories are not tracked by git until files are added (this is expected behavior)
  - Root `package.json` workspaces must include both `apps/*` and `packages/*` for monorepo structure
  - Turborepo automatically recognizes new workspaces once added to root package.json
  - Use `yarn lint` and `yarn build` to verify changes don't break existing code
