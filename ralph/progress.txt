## Mon Jan 19 08:59:49 CET 2026 - US-001
- Updated hero section messaging to emphasize audience safety and protection
- Changed headline from "Your subscribers, always accessible" to "Keep your audience safe and backed up"
- Updated subheadline to emphasize subscribers as most valuable asset, mention daily sync, backup capability, and ability to import if ESP has issues
- Changed CTA button from "Get Started Free" to "Get Started"
- Removed "No credit card required" text and replaced with "Credit card required to start"
- Updated badge from "Sync subscribers in seconds" to "Protect your most valuable asset" (changed icon from Zap to Shield)
- Files changed: `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The homepage is a single file component at `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx` with all sections (HeroSection, PricingSection, FAQSection) defined inline
  - HeroSection uses Shield icon from lucide-react for safety/protection messaging
  - Prettier auto-formatting will fix line breaks in long text strings automatically when running `yarn lint --fix`
  - The dev server runs on port 3000 and can be verified by checking the HTML output
  - All changes must pass both TypeScript typecheck (via `turbo run build --filter=frontend`) and ESLint (via `turbo run lint --filter=frontend`)

## Mon Jan 19 09:01:52 CET 2026 - US-002
- Rewrote hero subheadline to emphasize audience safety and protection messaging
- Updated subheadline to: "Your audience is your most valuable asset—keep it safe. We sync daily to maintain a secure backup of your updated list. Download anytime or import to another ESP if yours has issues. Your subscribers, always protected."
- Emphasized audience as most valuable asset with safety messaging
- Included backup capability and download/import functionality
- Files changed: `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The subheadline text should be concise and impactful while covering all key value propositions
  - Safety/protection messaging works well with phrases like "keep it safe" and "always protected"
  - Auto-fixed linting issues in generated files (next-env.d.ts) don't need to be tracked separately

## Mon Jan 19 09:03:45 CET 2026 - US-003
- Updated hero features row to emphasize daily sync frequency
- Changed feature text from "Auto-sync daily" to "Synced every day" for clearer messaging
- Maintained visual consistency with existing RefreshCw icon and styling
- Files changed: `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The hero features row is a simple array of objects with icon and text properties
  - "Synced every day" is clearer and more impactful than "Auto-sync daily" for emphasizing frequency
  - Browser verification can be done by checking the rendered HTML output from the dev server

## Mon Jan 19 09:15:00 CET 2026 - US-004
- Updated pricing section to remove all free trial messaging
- Changed CTA button from "Start your free trial" to "Get Started" (with Link wrapper to /login)

- Updated pricing section header from "Simple, transparent pricing" to "Super affordable pricing to keep your audience safe"
- Updated pricing section subheader to emphasize affordability and accessibility: "One plan. No hidden fees. We cover our costs while keeping it accessible to everyone."
- Files changed: `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PricingSection CTA button needs `asChild` prop when wrapping with Link component
  - Prettier will auto-format multi-line Button props when running `yarn lint --fix`
  - The pricing section header and subheader are in the PricingSection component, separate from the pricing card itself
  - Browser verification via curl shows the changes are correctly rendered in the HTML output
