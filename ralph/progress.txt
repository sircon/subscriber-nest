## 2026-01-19 - US-001
- Updated frontend homepage branding from SubscriberNest to AudienceSafe
- Navigation logo text changed to "AudienceSafe"
- Domain reference in screenshot changed from "subscribernest.com" to "audiencesafe.com"
- Footer logo and copyright updated to "AudienceSafe"
- FAQ section reference updated to "AudienceSafe"
- Files changed: `apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Homepage is a single file component (`apps/frontend/src/app/page.tsx`) with all sections (Navigation, Hero, Pricing, FAQ, Footer) defined as separate functions within the same file
  - Branding text appears in multiple places: navigation logo, footer logo, footer copyright, FAQ answers, and screenshot placeholder
  - Build and typecheck pass successfully; pre-existing lint errors in other files don't block commits
  - Frontend dev server runs on port 3000 (can be started with `turbo run dev --filter=frontend`)
